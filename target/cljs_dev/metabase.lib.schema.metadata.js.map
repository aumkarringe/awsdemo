I'm using `Column` as a more generic term that\n;;; includes not only `Field`s but also the columns returned by a stage of a query, e.g. `SELECT count(*) AS count`\n;;; returns a `Column` called `count`, but it's not a `Field` because it's not associated with an actual Field in the\n;;; application database.\n;;;\n;;; Column = any column returned by a query or stage of a query\n;;; Field  = a Column that is associated with a capital-F Field in the application database, i.e. has an `:id`\n;;;\n;;; All Fields are Columns, but not all Columns are Fields.\n;;;\n;;; Also worth a mention: we also have `Dimension`s, associated with the `dimension` table in the application\n;;; database, which can act like psuedo-Fields or affect how we treat normal Fields. For example, Dimensions are used\n;;; to implement column remapping, e.g. the GUI might display values of `categories.name` when it presents filter\n;;; options for `venues.category_id` -- you can remap a meaningless integer FK column to something more helpful.\n;;; 'Human readable values' like these can also be entered manually from the GUI, for example for enum columns. How\n;;; will this affect what MLv2 needs to know or does? Not clear at this point, but we'll probably want to abstract\n;;; away dealing with Dimensions in the future so the FE QB GUI doesn't need to special case them.\n\n(mr/def ::column-source\n  [:enum\n   ;; these are for things from some sort of source other than the current stage;\n   ;; they must be referenced with string names rather than Field IDs\n   :source/card\n   :source/native\n   :source/previous-stage\n   ;; these are for things that were introduced by the current stage of the query; `:field` references should be\n   ;; referenced with Field IDs if available.\n   ;;\n   ;; default columns returned by the `:source-table` for the current stage.\n   :source/table-defaults\n   ;; specifically introduced by the corresponding top-level clauses.\n   :source/fields\n   :source/aggregations\n   :source/breakouts\n   ;; introduced by a join, not necessarily ultimately returned.\n   :source/joins\n   ;; Introduced by `:expressions`; not necessarily ultimately returned.\n   :source/expressions\n   ;; Not even introduced, but 'visible' because this column is implicitly joinable.\n   :source/implicitly-joinable])\n\n;;; The way FieldValues/remapping works is hella confusing, because it involves the FieldValues table and Dimension\n;;; table, and the `has_field_values` column, nobody knows why life is like this TBH.
