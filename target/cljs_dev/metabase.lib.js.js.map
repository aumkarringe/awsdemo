metabase.lib.js\n  \"JavaScript-facing interface to MBQL Lib v2.\n\n  Generally, these functions wrap [[lib.core]] with conversion of inputs from JS data structures, and occasionally\n  from legacy MLv1 formats as well. Outputs are usually CLJS data structures intended to be treated as opaque in the FE.\n  Returned lists are converted from CLJS sequences to JS arrays (of opaque CLJS values).\n\n  On the TypeScript side, lint rules restrict importing this file to only the `frontend/src/metabase-lib/` directory.\n  That directory contains TS wrapper functions which add types and replace mangled Clojure names with idiomatic TS ones;\n  those wrappers are what get imported and used by the wider FE.\n\n  ## Terms and types\n\n  A reference of what is meant in these docs by \\\"column\\\", \\\"query\\\", etc. Most of the CLJS maps have a `:lib/type`\n  key, the values are indicated here. TS types are also indicated as eg. `Lib.ColumnMetadata`.\n\n  - **query** means a modern pMBQL query, represented as a CLJS map (`:mbql/query`, `Lib.Query`)\n  - **legacy query** and **MLv1 query** mean the previous form of MBQL, represented as a JSON object\n  - **column** means the full details of a column - its name, types, etc. (`:metadata/column`, `Lib.ColumnMetadata`)\n      - Columns can come from several sources: source tables, cards/models, previous stages of this query, aggregations,\n        etc.\n      - **field** means specifically a *column* which really exists in the data warehouse\n  - **clause** means a fragment of MBQL describing part of a query, such as an aggregation, breakout, join, etc.\n  - **ref** means a reference to a column.\n      - Often these are misleading called a \\\"field ref\\\", since they are represented as a `[:field ...]` clause in both\n        legacy MBQL and pMBQL.\n      - Refs are a code smell - they are an internal detail of MBQL structures that has leaked into many places in\n        legacy. All mention of refs should be eliminated from this interface eventually.\n\n  ## Code health\n\n  This API surface grew mostly organically during the development of MLv2 and porting the query builder to use it.\n  The result is that the API is not as systematic or clean as it could be. There are functions which are very specific\n  to a particular use case in one part of the FE, and functions which support legacy compatibility but should be removed\n  as those features are ported.\n\n  Health info is surfaced on each function, using these categories:\n\n  - **Healthy:** No issues; use these functions without concern.\n  - **Smelly:** This function isn't going away, but it needs some cleanup or improvement. Eg. maybe it's badly named.\n  - **Special use:** Exists to support a specific use case; new calls should generally be avoided. Ask if unsure.\n  - **Legacy:** Exists to support interop with legacy MLv1 queries, columns, field refs, etc. Can be used if needed,\n    but there will be notes on preferred alternatives that should be used if possible.\n  - **Deprecated:** No new calls; remove existing calls as practical; remove this function if there are no callers.\n    Docs will give an alternative to calling these functions that should cover all cases.\n\n  Over time, the *Deprecated* functions will be removed, and the *Legacy* ones will become obsolete and get removed as\n  legacy uses are ported to MLv2.\n\n  ## Display Info\n  The library functions typically return opaque CLJS data.
